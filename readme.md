# Reactor Performance Analysis Dashboard

This project creates a dashboard to visualize the performance of different reactor types (Batch, CSTR, PFR) under varying conditions (temperature, pressure, catalyst loading). The dashboard allows comparison between reactor types using Python tools like Streamlit, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
